# reversing-of-linklist
to reverse a link list just reverse its linking address
vis initially first node would be connected to and second and second to third and so on...
you just have to turn the linking by connecting second node to first aand third to second and so on...
it begins just by assigning first node link to null and second node link to first  and traversing til the last
print by assigning head to the last node
